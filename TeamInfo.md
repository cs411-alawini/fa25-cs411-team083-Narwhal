## Project Summary

Our project idea is to create an app that helps people find the most optimal medicines from their closest pharmacies. We will algorithmically find the ‘optimal’ medicines through 4 factors: how well it treats the patient’s symptoms, its side effects, its price, and the drug availability/distance required to get the drug. After the optimal medicines are found, we will also map the user to the closest pharmacy/supermarket that carries each medicine. 


We will leverage three primary databases on our backend to achieve this end. One contains pharmaceutical information about a plethora of medicines, including ratings and side effects. The second contains a list of pharmacies. To check for the closest pharmacies to a user's location, we will use the Google Maps API. The third (which is initially empty) will connect the first two databases by containing a list of pharmacies and the medicines they carry. We will gradually fill this database by making API calls to the pharmacies in the second database.
